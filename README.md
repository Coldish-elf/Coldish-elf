## Hi there 👋

I’m a first-year bachelor student at a Russian university (HSE), exploring my path in the world of IT. I’ve completed courses in C++, Python, data structures, and algorithms. I also have hands-on experience using Git, SQL, and basic web technologies. I also created primitive games, models and animations in blender, although I found that I am more attracted to backend systems, testing and devops than frontend development and gamedev and other industries where I tried myself.

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a first-year bachelor student at a Russian university (HSE), exploring my path in the world of IT. Iâ€™ve completed courses in C++, Python, data structures, and algorithms. I also have hands-on experience using Git, SQL, and basic web technologies. I also created primitive games, models and animations in blender, although I found that I am more attracted to backend systems, testing and devops than frontend development and gamedev and other industries where I tried myself.

## Projects

### School Projects

## Current Project: ProActive
Iâ€™m currently working on **ProActive**, a personal productivity assistant app that integrates backend logic, basic DevOps (CI/CD), and testing best practices.  
_(Note: The repository is private for now but will be made public later.)_

> I started ProActive to explore various tech fields, including backend development, QA, and DevOps.
